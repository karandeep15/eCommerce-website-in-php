# eCommerce-website-in-php
Hello Folks!
I have developed an ecommerce website- "SHOPPINGO" using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP and PHP, MYSQL.
This website consists of Admin and Users in which admin can add, update, delete products and also delete users.
Users can view products as well as add them to wishlist and add to cart options from where they can proceed to checkout by placing orders.

To run this project on your local computer, here are a list of things need to downloaded as well as installed:-
1. XAMPP server
2. PHP v8.1
3. MySQL Database Server

create a Database in phpmyadmin with the name "shop_db". Then import the shop_db.sql file from the project folder in phpmyadmin.
open your favourite browser and type localhost/shoppingo/home.php and press enter.
Your project is ready to go!!!
